## 🩸 **SESSION FLOW**

## 1️⃣ **HOOK: THE MISSING TRAVELER**

**Set-up:**  
The party arrives near Gallows Hollow following rumors of lost treasure — or hired to find a missing villager, _Korin_, who vanished while hunting near the Hollow.

> _Misty trees surround you, branches like gnarled claws scraping the dusk sky. Ahead, the forest breaks — a sunken village, roofs cracked and rotting under moss. The air is thick with copper and something worse — the smell of wet decay._
> 
> _Something shifts behind a collapsed house. A low groan echoes — like meat pulled apart._

---

## 2️⃣ **EXPLORATION: THE VILLAGE RUINS**

**Features:**

- Crumbling cottages.
    
- Claw marks and drag trails.
    
- Torn scraps of clothing.
    
- Bones strung into wind chimes.
    

**Key Discovery:**  
In one hut they find _Korin_ — or what’s left. His body is split open, ribcage splayed like wings, infested with small worm-like larvae.

**Skill Checks:**

- **Survival (DC 15)** — Tracks lead underground.
    
- **Medicine (DC 12)** — The wounds were done _after_ death, but the parasites still feed on him.
    


> _Inside, you find a man’s corpse propped upright. His chest is a split maw of ribs, pink and glistening, worms nesting where his heart should be. One eye flickers open, unfocused, lips moving in a wet hiss: “Below… she… hungers…”_

---

## 3️⃣ **THE SLAUGHTER CHAPEL**

A sunken church stands at the village’s center — its bell tower cracked. Animal bones litter the pews.

> _Candles gutter in pools of congealed fat. At the altar, a robed corpse kneels — spine bent backward, head twisted too far. It croaks: “Bring meat… feed the Mother…”_

**Encounter:**  
When disturbed, the corpse reanimates — **The [[Hollow Priest]]** (Undead Acolyte + Parasite Swarm).

**Treasure/Clue:**  
A torn journal: “When the famine came, we turned to the thing below — we fed it, and it fed us. But the hunger never stopped.”

_Stairs behind the altar lead into a tunnel of damp earth and faint pulsing red light._

---

## 4️⃣ **THE FLESH TUNNELS**

A winding descent into the Hive’s domain.


> _Walls shift with moist breathing. Veins pulse under thin, translucent flesh covering the tunnels. Every step squelches underfoot._

**Encounters:**

- **[[Flesh Larvae Swarm]]:** Drops from the ceiling. _On hit,_ [[players]] must make a CON save (DC 14) or a worm burrows under their skin.
    
- **Hollowed Choir:** Three villagers stitched together, humming in unison. They whisper PC’s secrets in familiar voices.
    

**Horror Effect:**

- PCs failing Wisdom saves gain hallucinations: hearing a loved one’s voice urging them to _stay_.
    

---

## 5️⃣ **THE HIVE WOMB**

The tunnels open into a cavern lit by a red, pulsating mass. [[The Mother Below]] hangs like a cancerous tumor — faces and limbs twitch inside her bulk. Dozens of villagers are cocooned along the walls.

> _The chamber throbs with wet, meaty life. A vast, tumor-like mass swells and contracts, veins spidering outward. Faces drift under its skin — pleading eyes, silent mouths. A wet voice echoes through your minds: “Hungry… join… feed…”_

---

## ⚔️ **FINAL ENCOUNTER: [[THE MOTHER BELOW]]**

**Mother Below (Homebrew):**

- Large stationary Aberration.
    
- Summons tendrils (legendary actions).
    
- Controls 2–3 **Meat Golems** (twisted villagers).
    
- Can grapple PCs and attempt to implant larvae.
    

🩸 **Special Mechanic:**

- PCs infected by larvae must pass CON saves each round or take necrotic damage.
    
- They can choose to _excise_ the parasite mid-fight, taking self-inflicted damage.
    

🧨 **Weakness:**

- Fire damages the Hive more than weapons.
    
- [[Players]] may find oil barrels, broken lanterns — improvising a burning solution.
    

---

## 🕯️ **ESCAPE OR SACRIFICE**

Once the Mother is slain, the Hive begins to collapse.

**Choices:**

- Fight free and flee as tunnels crumble.
    
- Or sacrifice part of themselves (someone stays behind to hold off the remaining Flesh Golems) to buy time.
    

---

## 🎭 **EPILOGUE**

> _You crawl from the tunnels, lungs burning, clothes soaked in blood and bile. Behind you, the Hollow sinks with a rumbling sigh. The forest is silent. The stars watch — cold and distant.  
> But under your skin, something still squirms._

---

## 🔪 **Optional Sanity/Horror Rules**

- Any time they fail a Wisdom save vs. fear, gain a Madness Point. 3+ means hallucinations.
