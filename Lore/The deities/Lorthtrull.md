# Ways of the Followers of Lorthtrull

### 1. **The Embrace of Shadows**

Followers believe that darkness is the final comfort, a soft, eternal embrace for those who suffer. To them, death is not to be feared but welcomed as a passage to true peace.

- Ritual: **"Veil of Night"** — a ceremony where the dying are wrapped in dark cloths and surrounded by black candles to ease their journey.
    

### 2. **The Silent Vigil**

Darkness teaches patience and introspection. Followers often meditate in absolute silence and pitch-black caves or temples for days, seeking clarity through sensory deprivation.

- Practice: **Pilgrimages** into ancient underground ruins, often alone and unarmed.
    

### 3. **The Guiding Hand**

Followers see themselves as guides for the dead and lost souls. They practice **death rites**, retrieving bodies from battlefields and dangerous places to offer them proper transition rituals under Lorthtrull’s watch.

- Order: **The Pallid Shepherds**, monks dressed in simple dark robes who care for both the living and the dead.
    

### 4. **The Dimming Flame**

As light can be destructive, followers perform rituals to **extinguish harmful light**.

- Action: They carry **black-lanterns** — lamps that absorb light instead of emitting it, symbolizing the "softening" of [[Aragthmere]]’s destructive blaze.
    

### 5. **The Sacred Oath of Non-Dominance**

Lorthtrull’s followers reject conquest or forceful rule. Death comes to all naturally; it must not be hastened by ambition or cruelty. To kill without cause is a grave sin.

- Exception: Mercy killings to end unbearable suffering are seen as acts of profound compassion.
    

### 6. **The Festival of the Black Bloom**

Once a year, during the longest night, followers celebrate with a midnight festival. Black flowers (either dyed or specially bred) are placed on graves, and stories of the deceased are shared.

- Purpose: To honor memory, teach humility, and remind the living of the peace that awaits.
    

### 7. **The Doctrine of Duality**

They recognize that even Darkness and Death exist because of the Cycle — without Light (even destructive), there would be no Darkness to offer refuge.

- Motto: **"In Her blaze, we suffer; in His shade, we heal."**
    

### 8. **The Guardians of the Last Door**

Some elite followers take on the sacred role of ensuring that no soul is enslaved, trapped, or corrupted after death.

- Title: **Duskwardens** — warriors who hunt undead, necromancers, and aberrations who violate the natural peace of the grave.
    

### 9. **The Path of the Moonless Night**

A rare, extreme path among zealots: they **blind themselves** ritually to never again see the false temptations of light. They navigate the world by sound, touch, and intuition alone.

- Nickname: **The Moonless**.
    

### 10. **The Covenant of Whispers**

Since darkness hides secrets, followers value discretion and communication through soft-spoken truth. Gossip, lies, and public shaming are strongly condemned.

- Belief: "Lies are the thorns in the Garden of Night."
