| 1   | You see your own reflection — your face is rotting, crawling with worms.                         |
| 2   | You hear your mother’s voice calling you to “come home” — but it’s coming from inside the walls. |
| 3   | Your companions look like walking corpses, twitching with parasites.                             |
| 4   | The ground pulses underfoot — you swear you feel a heartbeat.                                    |
| 5   | You hear distant laughter — children giggling under the flesh.                                   |
| 6   | You feel teeth scraping your skin from the inside.                                               |
| 7   | A voice whispers your deepest fear into your ear — you swear you see it crawl away.              |
| 8   | You taste blood and bile in your mouth for no reason.                                            |
| 9   | You hallucinate a loved one begging you to _feed_ them.                                          |
| 10  | Your skin feels wrong — you must scratch it open to free what’s inside.                          |
