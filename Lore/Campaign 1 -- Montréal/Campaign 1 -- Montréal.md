# Session 2

The party returns to [[Semper]] to gather their belongings from the **[[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]] ([[Porc dansant]])**, room 108, only to find the city has drastically changed. Adventurers are being hunted, and soldiers from the **[[Thirry]] family** roam the streets. The party must navigate this dangerous environment while preparing for their next steps.

---

### **1. Arrival in [[Semper]] (Exploration & Roleplay)**

- **Mood**: Tense, with an undercurrent of unease as the city atmosphere has changed since they left.
- **Objective**: Gather belongings from the [[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]] and assess the situation in the city.

**Scene 1: Entering the City**

- As the party enters [[Semper]], describe the city’s vibrant streets now plastered with **wanted posters**. Each poster shows the faces of famous adventurers, creating an ominous tone.
    - **Perception or Investigation checks** reveal that every major adventurer in **[[Rendorsia]]** is being actively pursued, though the party isn’t yet wanted by name.
    - NPCs talk in hushed tones about how adventurers are being arrested or taken prisoner, but no one knows why.

**Scene 2: The [[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]] ([[Porc dansant]])**

- The inn remains lively, filled with adventurers seeking refuge. Describe how the **[[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]]** serves as a sanctuary—its patrons are nervous, but the innkeeper and patrons are openly defiant of the city's changing politics.
    - When the party heads to their room (108), they find their belongings intact. However, an NPC adventurer (possibly an ally or rival) warns them: “It won’t be safe here for long. The **[[Thirry]] soldiers** are cracking down on every guild and party they can find.”

---

### **2. The Rising Danger (Roleplay & Stealth)**

- **Mood**: Suspenseful, as the [[players]] begin to feel the encroaching danger within the city.
- **Objective**: Learn more about the current situation and avoid being captured by the soldiers.

**Scene 1: A Growing Threat**

- As the party spends time in the **[[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]]**, they notice the tension rising in the streets. The inn’s staff warns that soldiers are patrolling the city, and adventurers are disappearing.
    - **Insight checks** may help [[players]] gauge who they can trust among the inn’s patrons and staff. Some may suggest fleeing the city; others might propose laying low or preparing for a fight.

**Scene 2: Soldiers in the Streets**

- While moving through the city, the [[players]] encounter **[[Thirry]] family soldiers** patrolling aggressively.
    - **Stealth checks** may be necessary to avoid being questioned or captured.
    - The party may overhear soldiers talking about rounding up all adventurers and speculating that **[[Rendorsia]]’s** adventurers are being targeted to prevent a potential rebellion or alliance against the ruling houses.

**Optional Combat/Chase**: If the party draws too much attention or fails stealth checks, they could get into a skirmish with a small patrol. Alternatively, they might be pursued, needing to find a safe place to hide (alleyways, rooftops, or sympathetic NPCs).

---

### **3. Uncovering the Plot (Investigation & Social Interaction)**

- **Mood**: Mystery and conspiracy, as the [[players]] begin to put together the reasons behind the hunt for adventurers.
- **Objective**: Investigate the city and find out why adventurers are being targeted.

**Scene 1: Gathering Information**

- The [[players]] can ask around in the **[[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]]** or among city contacts to learn more about why the **[[Thirry]] family** soldiers are targeting adventurers. Several theories circulate:
    - Some believe it’s because adventurers have gained too much power and influence.
    - Others think it’s tied to political maneuvering within **[[Rendorsia]]**
    - The **[[Thirry]] family** fears that adventurers will rally to another noble house.

**Scene 2: A Secret Message**

- One of the party’s contacts (perhaps a former ally or guild member) secretly hands them a note, warning of an imminent crackdown. The note suggests there’s a bounty for the capture of entire adventuring parties and hints at a potential **safehouse** in the city where the [[players]] could regroup or seek refuge.
    - This note could also hint at a **rebel faction** forming in the city, made up of adventurers trying to fight back.

---

### **4. Escaping or Fending Off the Soldiers (Combat or Stealth)**

- **Mood**: Desperation, as the city becomes more hostile.
- **Objective**: Avoid capture or stand their ground against the soldiers.

**Scene 1: Streets No Longer Safe**

- The streets become dangerous as more **[[Thirry]] soldiers** flood the area, looking for adventurers.
    - The party must decide: **escape** the city now or **stand and fight**.
        - **If they choose to flee**: The party could use underground passages, sympathetic NPCs, or stealthy routes to leave the city undetected.
        - **If they stand their ground**: The soldiers will eventually find them. This could lead to an intense combat encounter at the **[[Porc dansant|Dancing Pork]]**, with other adventurers potentially joining the fight. The [[players]] could either defeat the soldiers or use the chaos to escape.

**Scene 2: A Final Confrontation**

- If they fight, the soldiers will eventually be driven off or overwhelmed by the inn’s adventurers. The party might gain a reputation for standing up to the soldiers, but they’ll also become targets for further attacks.
    - If they escape, end the session with them finding refuge in the city’s underground, where they can plan their next move in relative safety.

---

### **5. Session Conclusion**

- The session ends with the party at a crossroads: either escaping [[Semper]] entirely or preparing for a larger conflict with the **[[Thirry]] family** soldiers.
- Regardless of their choice, they will know that [[Semper]] is no longer a safe place for adventurers, and the situation in **[[Rendorsia]]** is becoming more dangerous by the day.
