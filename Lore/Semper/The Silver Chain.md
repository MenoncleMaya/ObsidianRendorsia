### **The Silver Chain (Criminal Syndicate & Merchant Guild)**

- **Mood**: Deceptive, charming, and calculating.
- **Ideology**: “Freedom through wealth and cunning.” The Silver Chain is a blend of criminal syndicate and merchant guild, moving easily between legal and illegal business. They believe that wealth is the ultimate freedom, and they will manipulate, cheat, and steal to obtain it. They maintain a friendly public image as a legitimate merchant organization while running criminal operations behind the scenes.
- **Relations**:
    - **Allied with**: **[[The Black Serpents]]**, working together to maintain control of the black market.
    - **Neutral with**: **[[The Golden Tide]]**, cooperating on rare occasions when mutual interests align.
- **Money Gaining**: The Silver Chain operates legitimate businesses—trade routes, merchant shops, and legal goods. However, they also run illegal operations in smuggling, fencing stolen goods, gambling dens, and counterfeiting. Their ability to blend both legal and illegal enterprises makes them extremely wealthy and dangerous.


**The Pact with [[Kerälia]]**

The [[The Silver Chain|Silver Chain]], a powerful and cunning faction thriving in both commerce and crime, unknowingly built their temple atop the slumbering [[Kerälia]]’s lair. When they discovered the dragon beneath them, they struck an uneasy alliance. [[Kerälia]], still recovering from its grievous wounds, agreed to aid the Silver Chain in exchange for resources and protection. The Silver Chain, in turn, gained access to the vast wealth, power, and knowledge of the ancient dragon. This symbiotic relationship allowed [[Kerälia]] to grow stronger, while the Silver Chain expanded its influence using the dragon's wisdom and hidden treasures.

### **The [[Kenku]] Experiment: A Failed Creation**

In pursuit of ultimate power, the founders of the Silver Chain, guided by [[Kerälia]]’s arcane knowledge, sought to create a new race—one superior to the flawed mortals that already walked the world. Using the Transmutation Stone’s energy, they attempted to craft a species of enhanced beings, intelligent and loyal, designed to serve the Silver Chain’s cause. However, the experiment did not go as planned.

Instead of a superior species, the process twisted and corrupted the essence of their subjects, resulting in the birth of the [[Kenku]]. These bird-like humanoids bore the scars of their unnatural origins, cursed with an inability to create, their voices stolen, and their potential stifled. The Silver Chain saw them as a failure and, rather than destroy them, repurposed them as an expendable workforce. The [[Kenku]] were forced into servitude, used as slaves to expand [[the Underground Cities]] of the Silver Chain, mining, building, and carrying out menial tasks.
