### **The Silver Chain (Criminal Syndicate & Merchant Guild)**

- **Mood**: Deceptive, charming, and calculating.
- **Ideology**: “Freedom through wealth and cunning.” The Silver Chain is a blend of criminal syndicate and merchant guild, moving easily between legal and illegal business. They believe that wealth is the ultimate freedom, and they will manipulate, cheat, and steal to obtain it. They maintain a friendly public image as a legitimate merchant organization while running criminal operations behind the scenes.
- **Relations**:
    - **Allied with**: **[[The Black Serpents]]**, working together to maintain control of the black market.
    - **Neutral with**: **[[The Golden Tide]]**, cooperating on rare occasions when mutual interests align.
- **Money Gaining**: The Silver Chain operates legitimate businesses—trade routes, merchant shops, and legal goods. However, they also run illegal operations in smuggling, fencing stolen goods, gambling dens, and counterfeiting. Their ability to blend both legal and illegal enterprises makes them extremely wealthy and dangerous.
