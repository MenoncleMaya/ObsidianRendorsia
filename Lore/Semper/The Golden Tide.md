### **The Golden Tide (Merchant Guild)**

- **Mood**: Opportunistic, shrewd, but outwardly friendly.
- **Ideology**: “Trade brings prosperity to all who work for it.” The Golden Tide believes that commerce is the path to power and influence. They see themselves as the rightful rulers of the economic landscape, using wealth to influence politics and ensure their dominance.
- **Relations**:
    - **Allied with**: **[[The Iron Seekers]]**, since they provide protection to their trade routes.
    - **Neutral with**: **[[The Silver Chain]]** (criminal syndicate), as they occasionally use underworld connections for smuggling and black-market deals.
    - **Tense with**: **[[The Ravenborn Company]]** (adventurer guild), who refuse to work with them due to the Golden Tide’s shady dealings.
- **Money Gaining**: They control major trade routes, monopolize certain goods, and have a vast network of merchants and ships. They also dabble in under-the-table deals, black-market trading, and, in times of war, weapon smuggling.
