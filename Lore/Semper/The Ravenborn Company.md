### **The Ravenborn Company (Adventurer Faction)**

- **Mood**: Chaotic, rebellious, and self-reliant.
- **Ideology**: “The only law is the one we make.” The Ravenborn believe that adventurers should be free from the control of nobles, merchants, and kings. They see themselves as true adventurers, living on the edge of society, taking what they need, and always staying one step ahead of authority.
- **Relations**:
    - **Hostile with**: **[[The Golden Tide]]**, whom they view as exploitative and greedy. They refuse to work with any merchant guild that tries to manipulate adventurers for profit.
    - **Neutral with**: **[[The Iron Seekers]]**, though they view them as too rigid and beholden to the noble class.
- **Money Gaining**: The Ravenborn make their money through looting dungeons, hunting monsters, and selling rare artifacts and treasures on the black market. They also take on dangerous, high-risk jobs that other adventurers won’t touch, thriving in chaos and danger.
