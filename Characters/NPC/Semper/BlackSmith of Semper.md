  - Ferra Stormforge

**Name:** Ferra Stormforge  
**Race:** Human  
**Gender:** Female  
**Age:** 45  
**Appearance:** Ferra is tall and muscular, with a weathered face and numerous burn scars on her arms from years of working the forge. Her thick brown hair is streaked with gray and usually tied back into a tight bun. She wears a leather apron over simple, soot-stained clothes, and a heavy, ornate hammer always hangs from her belt.

**Personality:**  
Ferra is tough, straightforward, and a bit gruff, but she has a strong sense of duty to [[Semper]]. While she speaks bluntly, she has a soft spot for adventurers, especially those who show respect for craftsmanship. She dislikes nobles and soldiers, blaming them for causing more destruction than good.

**Background:**  
Ferra has lived in [[Semper]] all her life, inheriting the Stormforge smithy from her father. She once crafted weapons for the [[Thirry]] regime, including arms for [[Anselmet, le Chaotique|General Anselmet]]. After witnessing the brutal use of her creations, she became disillusioned and now prefers to craft armor and tools for farmers, hunters, and adventurers rather than weapons for the military.

**Specialties:**

- **Master Armor Smith:** Ferra is renowned for crafting some of the most durable armor in the region. Adventurers and mercenaries alike seek her out for repairs and custom commissions.
- **Enchanting Skills:** Though not a full mage, Ferra knows some basic enchantments passed down through her family. She can infuse weapons and armor with minor magical properties, such as fire resistance or increased durability.

**Plot Hooks:**

- **Ties to [[Anselmet, le Chaotique|General Anselmet]]:** If the party investigates the connection between the [[Thirry]] regime and [[Anselmet, le Chaotique|General Anselmet]], Ferra could provide insights or even reveal secrets about the weapons she made for him.
- **Weapon Commissions:** Ferra could offer to forge a custom weapon or armor piece for the party, provided they retrieve rare materials from dangerous locations.
