- **Class**: Fighter (Champion)
- **Personality**: A pragmatic and grounded leader, Corwyn prefers action over words. He often serves as the voice of reason and mediator within the group. Beneath his gruff exterior, he hides a sense of vulnerability about his past failures.
- **Visuals**: A broad-shouldered, middle-aged man with weathered tan skin and short salt-and-pepper hair. His armor is dented but well-maintained, marked with the sigil of a forgotten noble house. He wields a heavy, two-handed longsword and a battered but sturdy shield.
