# **High Priest Doldrim Runesoul** _(Voice of the Stone, Keeper of the Sacred Forge – CR 8)_

_"The gods whisper through stone and steel. It is our duty to listen."_

High Priest Doldrim Runesoul is the spiritual leader of the Deepstone dwarves, a devoted cleric of **Moradin, the All-Hammer**. He is a **dwarf of ancient wisdom**, his beard long and braided with runed iron rings, his eyes glowing faintly with divine light. He wears a **mithral-forged ceremonial breastplate** and wields **Runeflame**, a blessed warhammer that burns with celestial fire. His role is to **counsel King Duregar** and ensure that the dwarves remain true to their traditions.

Doldrim is known for his **stoic demeanor** but is **not easily manipulated**. He values **truth, honor, and the preservation of dwarven culture** above all. While he **fears the dangers of the deep tunnels**, he is also one of the few who knows **the old prophecies warning of an ancient evil lurking below.**

## **Lair Effects (Temple of the Stonefather)**

If the party encounters Doldrim in his temple, Moradin’s presence empowers him. On **[[Initiative]] Count 20 (losing ties)**, one of the following effects occurs:

- **Sacred Walls.** The temple **shifts and fortifies**, granting **half cover to allies** and making the floor difficult terrain for enemies.

---

## **Personality & Roleplaying**

Doldrim is **wise and cautious**, deeply concerned about the **prophecies of the deep tunnels**. He **respects warriors**, but **hates greed and arrogance**. While he **counsels King Duregar**, he is **not his puppet**—he values faith over politics.

- **Mannerisms:** Speaks in slow, measured tones. Always touches his runed beard when deep in thought.
- **Beliefs:** "The gods forged us from stone and fire. We must not let our heritage crumble."
- **Weaknesses:** His **duty to tradition** can make him blind to necessary change.

---

### **Possible Political Conflict Hooks**

1. **The Rift Between Faith and Rule.** Doldrim believes **the king has grown too rigid**, fearing that isolation will doom them all. He may be persuaded to **speak on the party’s behalf**—but **only if they prove their worth**.
2. **Prophecy of the Deep.** The tunnels are **not merely abandoned**—they hold **a forgotten evil**. Doldrim has read the ancient texts but **does not yet know the full truth**.
3. **The Corruption Below.** Dwarves **venturing too deep return changed**, whispering of **dark voices**. Doldrim suspects that **Moradin’s temple must be reforged** to protect the dwarves, but King Duregar is skeptical.
4. **The Test of Worth.** If the party wishes **his blessing**, they must undergo **a dwarven trial of faith and strength**—perhaps a **fight against a divine construct** or **a test of honor and loyalty**.
