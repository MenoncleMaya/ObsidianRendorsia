_"Stone endures. Fire tempers. And a true king never bends."_

A ruler of unwavering will, King Duregar Ironheart has led the Deepstone dwarves for over 200 years. His body is scarred from countless battles, clad in runed obsidian-black plate armor.

### **Possible Political Conflict Hooks**

2. **The Monster in the Deep.** The abandoned tunnels **hide something ancient**. The king knows of it but will **not admit weakness**.
3. **A Hidden Betrayal.** One of the king’s thanes **secretly works for an outside power** and seeks to **weaken** him.
4. **Dwarven Honor.** If the party can **prove their strength**, the king may grant them **passage**, begrudgingly.
