## Backstory
Biby is a Giff who was trained as a swordsman by his father as a child. His father, Bartolome, Always taught him that patience and virtue will always prevail over hastiness and fury. He reflected that through all of his teaching. At the age of 16, Bart told Bibyrgymos he was ready to face the dangers of the world and leave him to his plowshare in the countryside. He referred Biby to a human who would help him get on his feet once he arrived in the city. He would come in useful to his society as a warrior and a guardian. And most importantly be shown some level of respect which will be eventually rare throughout his journey. Biby continued his training, learning the in’s and out’s of covert operations. With his large size, he would stop most from fighting. Those that opposed him quickly found out that his size did not mean his intellect was left aside. Through discipline and strategy he fought like every battle was a piece of art for him to learn from. He made fast friends with people in The Cloak and dagger organization, as they shared many ideals. One who he was particularly fond of from the start was Gunter Fischer. An expert of covert operation with a good taste of style. Biby’s main jobs are on protection of assets. Although he would shine in destroying the remains of organizations through midnight raids.
