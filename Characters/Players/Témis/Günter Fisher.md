## Backstory
Günter Fischer is a man who lives a double life in many ways. 

In his youth he walked around looking like a human, when he was in fact a changeling. In a world of pure hatred against people of other kinds, he had no choice but to hide his true appearance. 

One day at the age of 16, he fell in love with a cute human girl named Luna. Even with the person Günter loved the most in this world he would never change back to his natural self, although it got close at many moments. 

After 5 years of being married, Günter at the age of 21 started looking for a job in a weird, but classy place. The Cloak and dagger was the name of the group running the place. This was a dangerous job that involved killing and manipulating evil people of the world. The organization did not discriminate against Günter because of his charisma and his ability to transform his appearance into whatever he sees. Günter quickly ranked up in the Cloak and dagger while still having a love interest with Luna.
