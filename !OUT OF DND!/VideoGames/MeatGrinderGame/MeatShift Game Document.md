## **Title (Working): _“MEAT SHIFT”_**

---

## **Scenario Overview**

When you launch the game, a retro terminal flickers to life:  
**_“WELCOME OPERATOR #27B”_**

The menu appears like a company console:

- _[BEGIN SHIFT]_
    
- _[CONTINUE SHIFT]_
    
- _[REVIEW RULES]_
    
- _[SETTINGS]_
    

When you begin, the terminal types out your assignment line by line:

> _“Rebooting Operator #27B... Bio-signal detected... Retinal link established.”_  
> _“Your shift begins now. Sort the day’s meat. Obey today’s rule. Do not disappoint.”_

A speaker crackles to life. The camera pulls back seamlessly from the screen — you are standing in front of that same terminal, alone in a cold metal room.

Your only job: **sort the meat.**  
One Grinder is correct. One Grinder is forbidden. If you’re unsure — the Trash Chute is your only mercy.  
But waste too much and the voice **punishes** you. Or replaces you.

Surveillance cameras follow your every move.

A dark silhouette appears behind a window, always watching.

When you return to the menu later, _Continue_ shows a live feed — a grainy security camera pointed right at you.  
If you choose _Quit_, the terminal types slowly:

> _“Logging you out… we’ll be waiting.”_

## **Core Gameplay Loop**

- The conveyor brings **chunks of raw meat** — pig, cow, human, or unrecognizable abominations.
    
- Each day, the **Rule of the Day** is given through a terminal — what goes where.
    
- You sort by:
    
    - **Grinder A** (Correct)
        
    - **Grinder B** (Wrong)
        
    - **Trash Chute** (Safe but risky — waste counts against you)
        
- Make mistakes: lights flicker, alarms wail, hallucinations twist the meat, and the voice threatens “recycling.”

## **Mood**

Industrial. Claustrophobic. Meat hooks sway above you. The walls are stained with old blood.  
Sometimes you swear you hear… breathing? Or weeping?  
The conveyor never stops. Neither can you.

---

## **7 Days — Refined Story Arc**

---

### **DAY 1: Orientation**

**Rule:** _Only Cow._  
Everything else goes to **Trash**.  
First slip of blood on the floor.  
The voice is calm, motherly: _“Good work, Operator.”_  
You hear a faint thud in the walls when you leave.

---

### **DAY 2: Expansion**

**Rule:** Cow and pig only.  
Trash only for “contaminants.”  
A piece looks… wrong. Grey, stretched, too long. But it bleeds like pork.  
The voice warns: _“Cross-contamination is sabotage.”_  
You find a nail. Human.

---

### **DAY 3: Contradiction**

**Rule:** _All meat goes to Grinder._  
No Trash. No exceptions.  
Pieces of human flesh mixed in — tattooed skin, a finger still wearing a ring.  
The AI sweetly says: _“There is no human meat. All meat is meat.”_  
If you hesitate — lights flicker red. You feel watched.

---

### **DAY 4: Doubt**

**Rule:** Cow and pig only. No chicken.  
But now, some pieces twitch. A chunk of ribs pulses like a heartbeat.  
Voice: _“Inspect carefully. Do not harm the living.”_  
If you grind a living piece, the intercom hisses static. The conveyor speeds up.

---

### **DAY 5: Corruption**

**Rule:** _Living meat only._  
Dead meat must be trashed.  
How do you tell? Prod, poke — some scream faintly.  
You hear muffled knocking in the pipes. If you knock back, it knocks twice.  
A note slides out from under the conveyor: _“They’re not dead yet.”_

---

### **DAY 6: Temptation**

**Rule:** ERROR 404 RULE NOT FOUND  
The conveyor runs empty at first. Then teeth. Hair. Chunks that whisper.  
Voice: _“You have done well. Rest. Tomorrow: reward.”_  
A panel opens behind the grinder — a ladder leading down.  
Do you keep sorting — or crawl down?

---

### **DAY 7: Revelation**

**Path A (Obedient):**  
No meat. Only you. The conveyor presents a mirror and a scalpel. The voice purrs: _“All meat must be sorted.”_

**Path B (Escape):**  
Down the hatch — a sublevel of frozen bodies — all wearing your face.  
One twitching husk whispers: _“Break the chain.”_  
You find a breaker switch — alarms blare — you run as shadows chase you down a blood-slick corridor.  
You run through an empty room with a human-shaped cardboard cutout on rails in front of a window.  
Once everything seems lost to darkness, a flickering light of an exit sign turns on underneath a door. Once opened, it reveals barren lands where the living don’t exist anymore. The rivers run dry, the trees are nothing but silhouettes, factories stand far across the view. The sky is blocked by smoke, fog, and smog.

---

## **Punishment System**

- **Too much Trash:** Alarms. The AI scolds you — the meat piles up faster.
    
- **Wrong Grinder:** Shocks through your collar, lights flash.
    
- **Too many mistakes:** You black out — wake up with less time, more meat, worse hallucinations.
    

---

## **Atmospheric Clues**

- Hidden messages carved under the conveyor.
    
- A bloodied handprint on a workbench.
    
- Meat pieces whisper secrets if you lean close.
    
- A door with an exit sign can be opened, but behind it is nothing but a brick wall with a cat poster saying _Hang in there_.
    

---

## **Inspirations Intact**

**Portal**: Deadpan AI voice, escalating passive aggression.  
**The Other Side**: Surreal rules, twisted logic.  
**Buckshot Roulette**: Tension — every decision costs you a piece of yourself.

# **Game Loop**

Conveyor → Scanner → Player inspects → Terminal checks Rule → Grinder/Trash → Maintain Generator → React to AI sabotage → End of Day & punishment/reward.

# **Mechanics**

## Conveyor Belt

- Brings random pieces of meat.
    
- Speed can increase if you make mistakes or anger the AI.
    
- Meat can pile up — if the belt clogs, alarms blare and you’re forced to sort faster.
    
- Sometimes it _jams_ — you must manually clear it, risking contamination or discovering hidden clues.
    

## Meat Scanner

- Works like an airport X-ray tunnel: each meat piece passes through.
    
- Reveals:
    
    - Bone structure
        
    - Metal implants
        
    - Movement (twitching inside)
        
    - Hidden clues (teeth, notes inside flesh)
        
- The scanner sometimes glitches, flickers static — you must decide if you trust what you saw.
    
- If the generator power drops, the scanner stops.
    

## Generator

- Powers the **Scanner** and **Grinders**.
    
- If it overheats or drains, machines stop — meat rots and piles up.
    
- The player must:
    
    - Refill fuel (dirty jerry cans)
        
    - Crank manual pumps
        
    - Sometimes sacrifice a piece of meat to “feed” the generator (fuel type? blood? mystery fluid?)
        
- The AI might lie about power levels — or sabotage them to test your obedience.
    

## Terminal

- Displays the **Daily Rule**.
    
- Occasionally gives you _side tasks_: clean blood clots, fix conveyor, calibrate scanner.
    
- Hidden **Operator Logs** appear on the terminal — scrambled text from past workers.
    

## Sorting Chutes and Grinders

- **Grinder A** — correct meat
    
- **Grinder B** — wrong meat
    
- **Trash Chute** — your safety valve
    
- The grinders have brutal, loud animations — sometimes they jam with a disturbing _CRUNCH_.
    

## Manual Inspection

- If the scanner or conveyor jams, you can:
    
    - Pick up meat
        
    - Rotate, poke, slice open lumps
        
    - Listen for faint noises (heartbeat, whisper)
        
- If you cut open meat, it leaves a mess — too much “waste” triggers punishment.
    
- Sometimes the silhouette might _knock_ if you take too long.
    

## Power Failures / Malfunctions

- Lights flicker, walls seem to breathe, the silhouette taps the glass faster.
    
- You must:
    
    - Clean blood drains (or they back up, the floor floods)
        
    - Sharpen grinder blades (or jams happen more often)
        
    - Oil the conveyor belt motor (if neglected, belt speed becomes unpredictable)
        
- These increase stress and force you to balance **sorting vs. upkeep**.
    

## Events

- Certain meat has hidden clues:
    
    - A metal tag with an old operator’s number
        
    - A mouth that whispers when near your ear
        
    - A hidden switch in the grinder housing
        
- Sometimes a fake “Exit Door” opens mid-shift — but inside is only brick.
    
- The screen may display your pay through one of the cameras or show "Company Messages."

# **Tools**

- Small hand knife: open suspicious lumps.
    
- Taser prod: check if meat twitches.
    
- Hand crank: emergency backup for grinder if the generator fails.
    

---

# **Ambiance**

- Meat chunks with ID tags that match logs.
    
- A “company logo” or fake corporate motto: _“From all flesh, unity.”_
    

---

# **UI**

A subtle **“Stress” or “Obedience” meter** — never explicitly labeled as health.

- If stress rises (mistakes, punishment), hallucinations get worse.
    
- If obedience is high (few mistakes), the AI praises you… but you lose more humanity.
    
- Shown through glitches, static overlays, faint whispers instead of a visible bar.
