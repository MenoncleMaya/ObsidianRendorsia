Kerälia is an Anciant blue dragon who resolved to create its lair deep underground after losing one of its wings in a fight against (insert two dragons). Kerälia was found a long time after the reign of the dragons. The community of [[the silver chain]] has been in touched with Kerälia since the moment they've build a temple over its lair. Their symbiotic relation has kept Kerälia fed and growing while [[the Silver Chain]] gained in power with the ressources furnished by Kerälia. One thing [[the silver chain]] didn't know was that Kerälia owned the transmutation stone, the one treasure hunted by the cult. Kerälia gained them in the long forgotten battle between the dragons and [[Aragthmere]].

**The Wingless Tyrant**

Kerälia is an ancient blue dragon who, after a catastrophic battle against the dragons Valzithar the Scorched and Xeyvorith the Eclipsed, was left crippled, losing one of its mighty wings. Defeated but not broken, Kerälia retreated deep underground, carving a vast lair beneath the earth where it could recover, scheme, and bide its time. Centuries passed, and in the aftermath of the reign of dragons, Kerälia's presence faded into obscurity—until it was rediscovered by a rising faction of mortals, the [[The Silver Chain|Silver Chain]].

### **The Hidden Power: The Transmutation Stone**

Unbeknownst to [[the Silver Chain]], Kerälia possessed an artifact of immeasurable power—the **Transmutation Stone**. This relic, sought after by an enigmatic [[Cult of Transmutation]], was won by Kerälia in the long-forgotten battle between dragons and [[Aragthmere]], a war that reshaped the world. The stone’s power could alter flesh and matter, turning one thing into another with permanent and often unpredictable results. Though Kerälia never revealed the stone’s true nature to [[the Silver Chain]], it experimented with its abilities, attempting to unlock the full extent of its magic.

**A Looming Conflict**

Kerälia, ever patient, watches these developments with amusement. To the ancient dragon, all these [[players]] are merely pieces on a vast, long-forgotten chessboard. Whether it aids [[the Silver Chain]], manipulates the cult, or turns the [[Kenku]] into a weapon of its own remains to be seen. One thing, however, is certain—change is coming, and those who stand in the dragon’s way will be nothing more than dust beneath its claws.
