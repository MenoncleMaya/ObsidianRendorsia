Kerälia is an Anciant blue dragon who resolved to create its lair deep underground after losing one of its wings in a fight against (insert two dragons). Kerälia was found a long time after the reign of the dragons. The community of [[the silver chain]] has been in touched with Kerälia since the moment they've build a temple over its lair. Their symbiotic relation has kept Kerälia fed and growing while [[the Silver Chain]] gained in power with the ressources furnished by Kerälia. One thing [[the silver chain]] didn't know was that Kerälia owned the transmutation stone, the one treasure hunted by the cult. Kerälia gained them in the long forgotten battle between the dragons and [[Aragthmere]].
