# Backstory
Drathakar, the Stone-Fanged Tyrant, is an awe-inspiring, god-like dragon of the deep. His colossal form is built like a moving mountain, his body covered in obsidian-like scales infused with veins of molten fire. His eyes burn like smoldering embers, and jagged crystalline spikes line his back, pulsing with ancient power. With no wings to carry him, he instead moves with terrifying agility, leaping great distances and burrowing through the earth like a living earthquake.

### **Domains of Power:**

Drathakar rules over the **underground**, **earthquakes**, and **wrathful protection**. He is worshiped by dwarves, deep-dwelling creatures, and those who seek unyielding strength. His presence is felt in the tremors of the land, in the shattering of stone, and in the eruptions of buried fury.

### **The Prayer of the Faithful:**

_"Drathakar, Keeper of Stone and Fury, may your strength ground us and your wrath shield us."_

- To the faithful, Drathakar is **both protector and destroyer**, a force of **stability and devastation**. His worshipers believe that when the earth quakes, it is a test of endurance—and when their enemies fall to the collapsing stone, it is his wrathful blessing.
- Deep shrines to him are **built within caverns**, marked by obsidian pillars and magma-filled runes.
- Some sects offer **shattered gemstones** or **forge weapons in his name**, believing that steel tempered in fire and stone holds his divine favor.

### **Legends of Drathakar:**

1. **The Sundering of Galdar-Kuun** – In an age long past, an empire of tyrants tried to enslave the creatures of the deep. Drathakar **rose from the abyss**, shattering their cities with a single quake, burying them forever beneath the ruins.
2. **The Stone-Warden’s Pact** – It is said that those who invoke his name in dire need may receive his protection. However, Drathakar demands tribute in return—whether it be blood, stone, or **an oath never to retreat**.
