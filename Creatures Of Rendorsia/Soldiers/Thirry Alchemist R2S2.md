### Traits

**Volatile Mixtures.**  
The Alchemist carries three experimental flasks. When reduced to 0 HP, roll a d6. On a 4–6, the satchel explodes (10-ft radius, 3d6 fire damage, Dex 15 half).

**Chemical Savant.**  
Advantage on saving throws against poison and acid, and resistance to poison damage.

**Tactical Mind.**  
As a bonus action, the Alchemist can direct one allied soldier within 30 ft to take the _Help_ action or move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Actions

**Multiattack.**  
The Alchemist makes two _Alchemical Throw_ attacks or one throw and one _Reagent Burst_ (if available).

**Alchemical Throw.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 30/90 ft, one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) acid damage.

**Reagent Burst (2/Day).**  
Throws a flask that explodes in a 10-ft radius. Choose one effect when thrown:

- **Acid Cloud:** All creatures in the area take 8 (2d8) acid damage and must succeed on a Dex 15 save or have their AC reduced by 1 until the end of their next turn (armor corrosion).
    
- **Smoke Bomb:** Creates heavy obscurement in a 10-ft radius for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Creatures inside are lightly obscured for the next round after leaving.
    
- **Fireburst:** All creatures in a 10-ft radius make Dex 15 saves; fail = 10 (3d6) fire damage, success = half. Wooden objects ignite.
    

**Experimental Syringe (Recharge 5–6).**  
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a Con 13 save or be _poisoned_ until the end of its next turn.

### Bonus Actions

**Stim Injection (1/Short Rest).**  
The Alchemist injects himself or an ally within 5 ft. The target gains 10 temporary HP and can take one extra weapon attack as a bonus action on its next turn.

---

### Reactions

**Chemical Counter.**  
When hit by a melee attack, the Alchemist can spill volatile liquid, forcing the attacker to make a Dex 15 save or take 5 (1d10) acid damage.

### Description

[[Thirry]] Alchemists are battlefield chemists drafted from industrial guilds. They wear soot-stained aprons over armored uniforms, gas-filter masks, and carry racks of vials. The air around them shimmers with acrid fumes and the smell of burned metal.

They are not front-line fighters — they **control space**, **disrupt formations**, and **synergize with heavy guards** by creating cover or choke zones.
