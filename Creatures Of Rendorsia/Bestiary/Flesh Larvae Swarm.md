**Traits**

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creatureâ€™s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny worm.

**Infectious Burrow.** When the swarm hits with a bite attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become _infested_ with flesh larvae.

An infested creature takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Removing the larvae requires a DC 15 Medicine check and a slashing tool (deals 1d6 damage to the creature).
