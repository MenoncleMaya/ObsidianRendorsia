_A shiny silver coin with a grinning goblin face on one side._

- **Effect:** Once per day, you can flip the coin to gain advantage on a roll.
- **Curse:** If it lands on goblin face, the DM chooses an absurd misfortune to happen immediately (e.g., a random item vanishes, a belt snaps, a goblin thief appears and runs off with something).
