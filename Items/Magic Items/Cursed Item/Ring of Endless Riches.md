### **Ring of Endless Riches**

_Looks like a golden ring set with a ruby that glows faintly._

- **Effect:** When worn, gold coins in your possession appear to double in number. You see twice the amount you actually have.
- **Curse:** The extra gold is an illusion. If you try to pay with it, the coins disappear, leading to awkward or dangerous situations.
