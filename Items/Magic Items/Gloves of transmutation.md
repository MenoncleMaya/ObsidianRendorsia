# The great Relic of [[Aragthmere]] 
The relic is a pair of gloves threaded in fine silk of gold, padded with the skin of an Ancient Silver Dragon. The wrist on the gloves are surrounded with gem stones. The back of the gloves each fits a bigger gem, two gems of transmutation giving the wearer the power of alchemy and equivalent exchange. Although, playing god has its price, the wearer will have to pay a fee to [[Aragthmere]] every time he uses the relic. (1D4 radiant damage)

The gems of transmutation are both missing from the gloves leaving them power less.
The two gems are thought to hidden deep inside of [[Ker√§lia]]'s lair.
