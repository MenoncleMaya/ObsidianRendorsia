### **Ravager's Warshield**

_Legendary, requires attunement by a Barbarian_

**Description:**  
Forged from reinforced with dwarven steel, this massive round shield is lined with jagged edges and built for both offense and defense. A beast-like emblem is carved into its surface, glowing faintly with primal energy when its wielder enters a rage.

**Properties:**

- **Thrown Shield:** The Ravagerâ€™s Warshield has the _Thrown (20/60)_ property. When thrown, it deals 1d8 Bludgeoning damage + Strength modifier. On a hit, the shield ricochets to another target within 20ft of the hit.
- **Brutal Impact:** If the shield hits a second target, it knocks the target back 5 feet and prone unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength modifier + proficiency bonus).
- **Unbreakable Aegis:** The shield grants a +2 bonus to AC.
- **Savage Block:** Once per rage, when hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to bash the attacker with the shield, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage and forcing them to make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
