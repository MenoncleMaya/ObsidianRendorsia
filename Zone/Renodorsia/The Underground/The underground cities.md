**The Hidden World Below**

Beneath the surface, [[the Silver Chain]] has built a network of hidden cities, fortified lairs, and slave camps where their influence is strongest. These darkened tunnels serve as the beating heart of their operation, where [[Kenku]] toils away under strict control. Yet, it is also a place where rebellion may one day riseâ€”a labyrinth where shadows whisper of change.

The underground cities can be accessed by:

- **The tunnels of the dwarves and [[goblins]] in the eastern [[mountains]] chains.**
    
- **A mysterious magical barrier in the middle of the lake of [[Semper]].**
    

These entrances remain well-guarded secrets, known only to the highest-ranking members of [[the Silver Chain]]. The barrier in the lake is an anomaly of ancient magic, requiring specific knowledge or artifacts to pass through, while the tunnels are perilous and filled with dangers both natural and artificial.
