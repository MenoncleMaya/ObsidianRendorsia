# 🌨️ Galeside, the Village Beneath the Tremor

## 🎭 Overview

> **"When the earth shakes, we bow — not in fear, but in respect."**

Galeside is a small northern settlement nestled between **pine-choked cliffs** and the frozen **River Tern**. It sits where two faiths quietly intertwine: the **wrathful strength of [[Drathakar]]**, and the **gentle stillness of [[Lorthtrull]]**.  
To outsiders, it is little more than a logging outpost with a fish market and a smokehouse.  
To those who stay, it is a **living shrine to balance** — between fire and shadow, fury and peace, life and death.

## 🏔️ Geography & Atmosphere

Galeside’s homes are **built into the hillside**, half-stone, half-wood, reinforced with thick beams carved with **runes of protection against quakes**. Even the wind seems to hum in their hollows. Snow drifts lazily through narrow streets where lanterns burn low — not bright — in deference to **[[Lorthtrull]]**, the god of darkness.

At night, the whole village glows in faint amber from **magma channels** hidden under the central square — a tribute to **[[Drathakar]]**, said to carry his warmth upward from the deep. The air smells of pine tar, smoked trout, and volcanic stone dust.

Travelers describe Galeside as _quiet, heavy, and warm beneath its silence._

## 🕯️ Faith and Ritual Life

### **The Twin Worship**

Here, the villagers do not separate **[[Drathakar]]** and **[[Lorthtrull]]** — they see them as **two halves of survival**:

- **[[Drathakar]]**, the Stone-Fanged Tyrant, gives strength, heat, and the courage to endure.
    
- **[[Lorthtrull]]**, the Keeper of Shadows, gives peace, patience, and mercy toward death.
    

It’s said **"The quake and the silence are both his voice."**

#### **Daily Practice**

- At dawn, miners and woodcutters press their palms to the ground and whisper:
    
    > “Keeper of Stone and Fury, may your strength ground us.”
    
- At dusk, black-lanterns are lit in doorways, whispering the prayer:
    
    > “Shade of the End, grant us rest from the blaze.”

## ⛪ Key Locations

### **1. The Church of the Deep Veil**

Built from **black basalt** and **bone-white marble**, the church stands half above and half below ground.  
The upper hall is devoted to **[[Lorthtrull]]**, where pallid candles burn blue and monks chant soft hymns that end in silence.  
The lower sanctum — the **Crypt of the Stone Veins** — is carved directly into the bedrock. There, molten cracks glow faintly like veins of fire, and offerings to **[[Drathakar]]** are left in small stone bowls: **blood, gold dust, or shards of broken steel.**

> The priesthood teaches: “To honor the dead is to calm the earth. To temper wrath with peace is to live.”

**High Curate:** Brother [[Gabriel]], a pale-skinned human with a cracked voice.  
He wears a molten-iron pendant in the shape of a dragon’s tooth, and when she speaks, the walls seem to hum faintly.

### **2. The Frosted Tern Tavern**

The heart of Galeside — a round, low-roofed tavern reinforced with stone ribs that quake safely during tremors.  
Its wooden beams are carved with curling dragon motifs and lines from the **Prayer of the Faithful**.  
The tavern serves **smoked lake trout**, **root stew**, and the famous **“Tremor Ale”**, brewed with volcanic ash and herbs that tingle the tongue.

The tavern’s hearth never goes out.  
Locals say its flames were gifted by [[Drathakar]] himself when the first settlers carved the village.  
The owner, **[[Olgard Brimsmoke]]**, is a burly woman who claims to have once seen the dragon’s shadow moving beneath the ice.

### **3. The Shaman’s Hut**

At the far end of the main road, half-buried under snow, sits **Maela Brime-Weave’s hut**, built around the stump of a petrified tree.  
Bundles of herbs and charms hang from the eaves, and a soft, green smoke seeps from her chimney.  
Inside, the air smells of ash, sage, and melted copper.

[[Nethra Blackveil]] is a **shaman of both gods**, a remnant of the old ways — part oracle, part apothecary.  
She brews **potions of frost protection and healing**, whispering blessings into each vial.  
Her left eye is blind and clouded; she says it “sees the deep glow beneath the earth.”

> _"The quake has a rhythm, little one. And if you listen… you can tell when it’s angry."_

### **4. The Obsidian Shrine**

A simple **open-air altar** on a cliff above the village, overlooking the frozen valley.  
Here, villagers leave **offerings of broken weapons** and **forged tools** in thanks to [[Drathakar]] for another month without catastrophe.  
Once a month, the villagers gather at midnight to feed the **Obsidian Flame** — a controlled fissure that glows with real molten fire.  
When the flames flare high, the faithful kneel and whisper:

> _"May your wrath shield us."_

It is said that if the earth quakes during the ritual, **[[Drathakar]] is pleased.**

## 👥 People and Culture

- **Population:** ~80 souls. Mostly humans and dwarves, with a handful of half-elves and one old gnome smith.
    
- **Mannerisms:** Calm, deliberate, and superstitious. When thunder rumbles, they pause mid-sentence to touch the ground.
    
- **Superstitions:**
    
    - Never whistle underground — it “calls [[Drathakar]]’s breath.”
        
    - Never bury a body in frozen ground — offer it to the **Black Veil** instead (wrapped in dark cloths, lowered into the Church crypt).
        
    - When someone dies suddenly, they say:
        
        > “The Stone wanted them back.”

## 🛠️ Economy and Survival

- **Primary Trades:** Mining iron and volcanic glass; fishing under the ice; brewing ash-ale.
    
- **Trade Routes:** Small caravans to **[[Truvel]]** twice a month; barter-based.
    
- **Currency of Faith:** Gold and stone are both sacred — every coin used is slightly chipped before spending, symbolizing that “nothing perfect endures.”

## ⚖️ Relationship with Outsiders

The villagers of Galeside are **kind but wary**.  
They offer warmth and food to travelers but demand respect for their gods and traditions.  
Mocking their faith or taking stones from the cliffs is **deeply taboo** — it risks “waking the mountain.”

Yet, beneath their caution, there’s hope. They believe that the **adventurers** who come north may be **part of [[Drathakar]]’s design** — new hands chosen to balance fury and mercy in the world above.

> _"When the mountain moves, so must we. Perhaps you are its tremor."_  
> — Brohter [[Gabriel]]
