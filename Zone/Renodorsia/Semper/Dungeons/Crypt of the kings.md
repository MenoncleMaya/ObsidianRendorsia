## **Dungeon Structure**

### **1. The Descent** (_Entry Room_)

**Description:** A grand staircase leads down into a vast hall lined with statues of past kings. The air is stale, and torches burn with an eerie blue flame. A massive stone door, inscribed with **"Only those who bear the blood may enter,"** blocks the way forward.

**Challenge:**

- **Puzzle:** A pressure plate requiring royal blood or a symbolic offering (e.g., an heirloom of [[Semper]], or the [[players]] can deceive the mechanism with a fake "royal blood" solution).
- **Failure:** Activates **Royal Warden Constructs**—statues that animate and attack.

### **2. The Hall of Kings** (_Traps & Lore Room_)

**Description:** A vast chamber lined with **sarcophagi of past rulers**. Ghostly voices whisper, recounting history. A shattered throne sits at the end, with skeletal remains crumbling upon it.

**Challenges:**

- **Undead Ambush:** The past kings, enraged by trespassers, rise as **Wights & Royal Wraiths** if the [[players]] disrespect the tombs.
- **Trap Puzzle:** The floor tiles shift when weight is applied. [[Players]] must cross using the correct sequence of historical symbols to avoid spikes and magical blasts.

### **3. The Trial of Kings** (_Moral Dilemma_)

**Description:** A hallway with four spectral figures representing legendary kings. Each king presents a challenge, forcing the party to prove their worth through combat, wisdom, or sacrifice.

**Challenges:**

- **King of War:** A duel against an undead champion wielding a cursed blade.
- **King of Shadows:** A riddle that, if answered wrong, summons a shadow assassin.
- **King of Blood:** Demands a drop of lifeblood from each adventurer—those who refuse are cursed (disadvantage on saving throws in the crypt).
- **King of Betrayal:** Asks a player to sacrifice an ally’s item or secret to proceed.

### **4. The Puppet Master's Message** (_Final Chamber_)

**Description:** A massive underground throne room with a **grand black sarcophagus** in the center, untouched for centuries. The walls are lined with murals depicting **events from the [[players]]' past**—proof that someone has been watching them.

**Event:**

- As the party approaches, a ghostly figure emerges—a **vision of a past king**, speaking with the voice of the Puppet Master.
- The Puppet Master reveals **he has been guiding them, manipulating them, and has a greater plan for [[Semper]]’s fate.**
- He offers a **choice:**
    1. **Accept his guidance**—he provides knowledge but binds them to his will.
    2. **Reject him**—triggering the awakening of the tomb’s **final guardian** (a powerful undead royal knight).

### **Final Encounter (Optional Boss Fight)**

- **King Vaelor the Everlasting** (Undead Revenant King)
    - HP: High, wielding a legendary greatsword.
    - Abilities: Shadow Step, Command Undead, Cursed Strike.
    - **If defeated:** The Puppet Master simply laughs, as if he expected this outcome.

### **Rewards & Consequences**
