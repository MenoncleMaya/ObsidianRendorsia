## **Dungeon Structure**

### **1. The Descent** (_Entry Room_)

**Description:** A grand staircase leads down into a vast hall lined with statues of past kings. The air is stale, and torches burn with an eerie blue flame. A massive stone door, inscribed with **"Only those who bear the blood may enter,"** blocks the way forward.

**Challenge:**

- **Puzzle:** A pressure plate requiring royal blood or a symbolic offering (e.g., an heirloom of [[Semper]], or the [[players]] can deceive the mechanism with a fake "royal blood" solution).
- **Failure:** Activates **Royal Warden Constructs**—statues that animate and attack.

### **2. The Hall of Kings** (_Traps & Lore Room_)

**Description:** A vast chamber lined with **sarcophagi of past rulers**. Ghostly voices whisper, recounting history. A shattered throne sits at the end, with skeletal remains crumbling upon it.

**Challenges:**

- **Undead Ambush:** The past kings, enraged by trespassers, rise as **Wights & Royal Wraiths** if the [[players]] disrespect the tombs.
- **Trap Puzzle:** The floor tiles shift when weight is applied. [[Players]] must cross using the correct sequence of historical symbols to avoid spikes and magical blasts.

---

### **3. The Trial of Kings** (_Moral Dilemma_)

**Description:** A hallway with four spectral figures representing legendary kings. Each king presents a challenge, forcing the party to prove their worth through combat, wisdom, or sacrifice.

**Challenges:**

- **King of War:** A duel against an undead champion wielding a cursed blade.
- **King of Shadows:** A riddle that, if answered wrong, summons a shadow assassin.
- **King of Blood:** Demands a drop of lifeblood from each adventurer—those who refuse are cursed (disadvantage on saving throws in the crypt).
- **King of Betrayal:** Asks a player to sacrifice an ally’s item or secret to proceed.

### **4. The Puppet Master's Message** (_Final Chamber_)

**Description:** A massive underground throne room with a **grand black sarcophagus** in the center, untouched for centuries. The walls are lined with murals depicting **events from the [[players]]' past**—proof that someone has been watching them.

**Event:**

- As the party approaches, a ghostly figure emerges—a **vision of a past king**, speaking with the voice of the Puppet Master.
- The Puppet Master reveals **he has been guiding them, manipulating them, and has a greater plan for [[Semper]]’s fate.**
- He offers a **choice:**
    1. **Accept his guidance**—he provides knowledge but binds them to his will.
    2. **Reject him**—triggering the awakening of the tomb’s **final guardian** (a powerful undead royal knight).

SHREIKER
- **Enemy’s Illusion:** Shreiker sees a **Kenku figure**, older, dressed in rags but wearing an identical holy symbol. They speak in fragmented mimicry, echoing phrases Shreiker has never heard before.
- **Psychological Conflict:** The figure stumbles toward him, reaching out, whispering pieces of a past Shreiker doesn’t remember. “Left you… for a reason…” “The truth… is dangerous…”
- **Combat Challenge:** This Kenku fights like a shadowy assassin, mirroring Shreiker’s own movements and abilities. Every time Shreiker strikes, the enemy responds with perfect mimicry.
- **Twist:** If defeated, the illusion breaks, revealing that Shreiker was fighting a hollow puppet all along, a metaphor for his fear that his past will never have answers.
URILENOIR
- **Ennemi Illusoire :** Gora, sa mère orc, enchaînée et implorante. Derrière elle, des paladins prêts à l’exécuter.
- **Conflit Psychologique :** L’illusion la fait parler : “As-tu honte de moi, mon fils ? Veux-tu vraiment devenir l’un des leurs ?”
- **Défi en Combat :** Il doit affronter des chevaliers de son ordre qui justifient l’exécution en lui disant que les orcs ne sont que des brutes sans honneur.
- **Twist :** S'il attaque les paladins, son reflet se transforme en brute sanguinaire. S'il laisse sa mère mourir, il se sent trahir ses origines. Seule une solution pacifique (un test de persuasion ou une épreuve de foi) permet de briser l’illusion sans conséquence psychologique.

### **Rewards & Consequences**
