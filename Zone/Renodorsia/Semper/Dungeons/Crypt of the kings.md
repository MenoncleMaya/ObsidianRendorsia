## **The Royal Crypt of [[Semper]]**

_A Dungeon for 5 [[Players]]_
[[Campaign 1 -- Montréal]]

The Royal Crypt of [[Semper]] is the final resting place of all the kings of [[Semper]], a massive underground necropolis filled with ancient secrets, royal guardians, and the lingering influence of the **Puppet Master**—the unseen force that has been manipulating the party. The crypt serves as a turning point, revealing that this figure has been watching them all along and has plans for them.

---

## **Dungeon Structure**

### **1. The Descent** (_Entry Room_)

**Description:** A grand staircase leads down into a vast hall lined with statues of past kings. The air is stale, and torches burn with an eerie blue flame. A massive stone door, inscribed with **"Only those who bear the blood may enter,"** blocks the way forward.

**Challenge:**

- **Puzzle:** A pressure plate requiring royal blood or a symbolic offering (e.g., an heirloom of [[Semper]], or the [[players]] can deceive the mechanism with a fake "royal blood" solution).
- **Failure:** Activates **Royal Warden Constructs**—statues that animate and attack.

---

### **2. The Hall of Kings** (_Traps & Lore Room_)

**Description:** A vast chamber lined with **sarcophagi of past rulers**. Ghostly voices whisper, recounting history. A shattered throne sits at the end, with skeletal remains crumbling upon it.

**Challenges:**

- **Undead Ambush:** The past kings, enraged by trespassers, rise as **Wights & Royal Wraiths** if the [[players]] disrespect the tombs.
- **Trap Puzzle:** The floor tiles shift when weight is applied. [[Players]] must cross using the correct sequence of historical symbols to avoid spikes and magical blasts.

---

### **3. The Trial of Kings** (_Moral Dilemma_)

**Description:** A hallway with four spectral figures representing legendary kings. Each king presents a challenge, forcing the party to prove their worth through combat, wisdom, or sacrifice.

**Challenges:**

- **King of War:** A duel against an undead champion wielding a cursed blade.
- **King of Shadows:** A riddle that, if answered wrong, summons a shadow assassin.
- **King of Blood:** Demands a drop of lifeblood from each adventurer—those who refuse are cursed (disadvantage on saving throws in the crypt).
- **King of Betrayal:** Asks a player to sacrifice an ally’s item or secret to proceed.

---

### **4. The Puppet Master's Message** (_Final Chamber_)

### **The Master Puppeteer’s Chamber**

As the party steps into the **heart of the lair**, they find themselves in a **vast, dimly lit chamber**. The room is **circular**, with walls made of **dark wood** resembling the inside of a marionette theater. Faint candlelight flickers from chandeliers made of **twisted, skeletal hands**, casting eerie, dancing shadows across the floor.

At the **center** of the chamber, a **massive throne of strings and wood** sits atop a raised platform. **Dangling marionettes**, lifeless but eerily humanoid, hang from the ceiling, their heads tilted unnaturally as if watching the newcomers.

### **The Five Smaller Rooms**

Around the chamber, five **wooden doors** stand equidistant from one another, each leading to a smaller room. The doors are marked with cryptic symbols, seemingly representing different aspects of manipulation:

1. **The Mask Room** – Shelves filled with ornate masks, each depicting different emotions: joy, sorrow, rage, and fear. The air feels heavy, as if stepping inside would force one to relive forgotten memories.
2. **The String Room** – Thousands of thin, enchanted strings stretch from ceiling to floor, some of them still twitching, as if something unseen is controlling them.
3. **The Marionette Workshop** – A grotesque collection of half-finished puppets lies scattered across wooden tables, their hollow eyes carved with unsettling precision. Some appear to resemble people the party might recognize.
4. **The Reflection Room** – A chamber lined with **mirrors**, but each reflection is slightly wrong—expressions that do not match, figures that move independently from the viewer.
5. **The Forgotten Chamber** – This door is **locked**, and something **scratches from the inside**, as if a puppet abandoned long ago still clings to a mockery of life.

### **The Master Puppeteer**

At the throne, a **tall, thin figure** sits, draped in **flowing black robes** with golden embroidery resembling tangled strings. His face is hidden behind a **porcelain mask**, cracked along the forehead. His hands, adorned with delicate rings, absentmindedly toy with **a single marionette**, its strings still leading into the darkness above.

His **cold, expectant voice** breaks the silence:

**“You are not my assassin. No matter. Shall we begin the show?”**

Would you like the Puppeteer to attack immediately, or should he engage in mind games first?

**Description:** A massive underground throne room with a **grand black sarcophagus** in the center, untouched for centuries. The walls are lined with murals depicting **events from the [[players]]' past**—proof that someone has been watching them.

**Event:**

- As the party approaches, a ghostly figure emerges—a **vision of a past king**, speaking with the voice of the Puppet Master.
- The Puppet Master reveals **he has been guiding them, manipulating them, and has a greater plan for [[Semper]]’s fate.**
- He offers a **choice:**
    1. **Accept his guidance**—he provides knowledge but binds them to his will.
    2. **Reject him**—triggering the awakening of the tomb’s **final guardian** (a powerful undead royal knight).

## [[Shrieker]]
- **Enemy’s Illusion:** Shreiker sees a **[[Kenku]] figure**, older, dressed in rags but wearing an identical holy symbol. They speak in fragmented mimicry, echoing phrases Shreiker has never heard before.
- **Psychological Conflict:** The figure stumbles toward him, reaching out, whispering pieces of a past Shreiker doesn’t remember. “Left you… for a reason…” “The truth… is dangerous…”
- **Combat Challenge:** This [[Kenku]] fights like a shadowy assassin, mirroring Shreiker’s own movements and abilities. Every time Shreiker strikes, the enemy responds with perfect mimicry.
- **Twist:** If defeated, the illusion breaks, revealing that Shreiker was fighting a hollow puppet all along, a metaphor for his fear that his past will never have answers.
## [[URILENOIR]]
- **Ennemi Illusoire :** Gora, sa mère orc, enchaînée et implorante. Derrière elle, des paladins prêts à l’exécuter.
- **Conflit Psychologique :** L’illusion la fait parler : “As-tu honte de moi, mon fils ? Veux-tu vraiment devenir l’un des leurs ?”
- **Défi en Combat :** Il doit affronter des chevaliers de son ordre qui justifient l’exécution en lui disant que les orcs ne sont que des brutes sans honneur.
- **Twist :** S'il attaque les paladins, son reflet se transforme en brute sanguinaire. S'il laisse sa mère mourir, il se sent trahir ses origines. Seule une solution pacifique (un test de persuasion ou une épreuve de foi) permet de briser l’illusion sans conséquence psychologique.
## [[Gadmus]]
### **Puppet Opponent: The Glass Prison**

A **massive glass jar** stands in the center of the room, its surface fogged with condensation. Inside, a **twisted, grotesque marionette-rat** floats in a viscous liquid, its limbs unnaturally elongated, its eyes hollow and glowing violet like the crystal he once held. This puppet represents both his suffering in the laboratory and the fact that he can never return to his old life.

**Encounter Mechanics:**

- The glass jar is **indestructible** at first. Whenever [[Gadmus]] attacks it, it **cracks slightly**, but the puppet inside **laughs cruelly** and whispers words from his past: _"You were happy. You were safe. And yet, you left. You abandoned them. They burned because of you."_
    
- Each turn, **a swarm of burning rats** emerges from the cracks, screeching in pain, representing his lost family. He must either destroy them (reliving his trauma) or find another way to break the jar.
    
- The only way to truly **shatter the jar** is to reject the guilt that holds him back—to embrace that while he was a victim, he still has the power to move forward.

**Twist**: Once the jar is shattered, the puppet rat inside crawls toward him, whispering the name of the princess he has forgotten—but never finishes saying it before dissolving into ash.

## [[Fhinn Toothpick]]’s Puppet Encounter
**Room Description:**  
Finn finds himself in a **massive wooden mead hall**, reminiscent of a barbarian’s feast. A great fire roars in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across towering wooden beams. **Mounted trophies of legendary beasts** line the walls, their eyes seeming to follow him. At the center of the room stands a **long banquet table**, overflowing with food.

At the head of the table sits a **large puppet**, eerily resembling his grandfather, **Crom Toothpick**. **The puppet is massive**, built from thick wood and leather, its face carved into a fierce grin, its eyes made of gleaming gemstones. It wears **a belt identical to Finn’s** and holds a **mug of ale in one hand and a massive axe in the other**.

---

### **The Challenge:**

As Finn steps closer, the puppet **slams the mug down**, the sound echoing unnaturally. Then, in a deep, hollow voice, it speaks:

**“Boy! You think you’re a hero? You think you’re worthy of the Toothpick name? HAH! You are nothing but a soft-footed child playing at adventure!”**

**Test of Legacy:**  
The puppet will challenge Finn in different ways, forcing him to prove his worth:

1. **Feast of Legends** – The puppet demands Finn **drink and eat** like a true warrior, but the food and drink are enchanted, causing strange effects. Perhaps the ale fills him with uncontrollable rage, or the food makes his body sluggish.
    
2. **Trial of Strength** – The puppet **throws Finn into a battle pit**, where he must fight **animated weapons, spectral warriors, or even a version of himself**, questioning whether he truly has the strength of a warrior.
    
3. **Burden of the Belt** – The puppet grows **larger and more monstrous**, claiming Finn is **too weak to carry his legacy**. The weight of his grandfather’s expectations manifests as a **physical force**, pressing down on him. Finn must decide: **Is he fighting for himself, or to be someone else?**

## **[[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]]’s Puppet Encounter**

**Room Description:**  
[[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]] steps into a **serene temple**, its architecture resembling the monastery where she trained. The walls are adorned with **golden banners** bearing her father’s teachings. Incense burns, filling the air with a soothing aroma. A large **meditation mat** lies in the center of the room, and on it sits a **wooden puppet**, carved in the image of her father.

The puppet wears **monastic robes** and has **calm, lifeless eyes**, but as [[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]] approaches, it slowly raises its head.

---

### **The Challenge:**

The puppet speaks in a voice eerily similar to her father’s:

**“My daughter… why did you abandon my teachings? Why did you stain your hands with the blood of an innocent?”**

[[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]] suddenly feels the **weight of her past actions**, as if the room itself is pressing down on her. The puppet remains motionless, waiting for an answer.

---

### **Trial of the Mind and Soul**

Instead of attacking her, the puppet **forces [[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]] into a vision**, reliving her worst moments:

1. **The Death of Her Father** – She sees herself arriving too late, again and again. No matter how fast she moves, she always finds him dying in her arms.
    
2. **Kaevon’s Last Breath** – She sees her blade plunging into Kaevon’s chest, but this time, he is **not a warrior**—he is a terrified, defenseless man, pleading for his life.
    
3. **The Shadowed Noble** – A faceless figure stands in the darkness, whispering, **“You still do not know the true hand behind your suffering.”**
    

---

### **Resolution**

- If [[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]] **gives in to her anger**, the puppet shakes its head, whispering, **“You have learned nothing.”** The room crumbles around her, forcing her to flee.
    
- If [[Lyriel Moostride|Lyriel]] **acknowledges her past without letting it define her**, the puppet **smiles softly**, saying, **“You seek redemption, my child. Then walk forward with an open heart, not a closed fist.”** The illusion fades, and she is allowed to pass.
# **Rewards & Consequences**

- **Ancient Relics of [[Semper]]:** Magic items or cursed artifacts from the tomb.
- **A New Target:** The Puppet Master considers them either allies or a threat, affecting future events.
- **The Crypt’s Collapse?** If they reject the Puppet Master, the crypt may begin to crumble, forcing an escape sequence.

**To My Most Delightful Marionettes,**

Did you enjoy the dance? The strings that tugged at your past, the whispers of forgotten truths, the weight of your own doubts? Each of you played your part so well—truly, I could not have choreographed it better myself.
You amuse me, all of you. But more than that, you fascinate me. Puppets who struggle against their strings—how beautifully tragic.

Keep struggling. Keep fighting. The show is not over yet.

With the fondest regard,  
**A Friend in the Dark**
