[[BlackSmith of Semper|Ferra Stormforge]]'s forge is a place of controlled chaos, where the heat and noise of metalworking permeate the air. Here’s a detailed description:

**Exterior:**  
The forge sits on the edge of [[Semper]]’s market district, just past a narrow, cobblestone alley. Its sturdy stone walls are blackened with soot, and a thick plume of smoke rises from the tall chimney, visible from several streets away. Above the wide wooden door hangs a faded iron sign in the shape of an anvil, with the name "Stormforge" engraved in Old Common. The front of the building has large windows, allowing passersby to glance inside at the glowing furnace and bustling work area. A sturdy wooden bench sits near the entrance, often occupied by waiting customers or travelers examining their newly acquired gear.

**Interior:**  
Upon entering, the smell of hot iron and coal fills the air, accompanied by the rhythmic clanging of hammer on metal. The forge is dimly lit, with the orange-red glow of the forge fires providing most of the light. The walls are lined with tools: hammers of all sizes, tongs, chisels, and other implements, each worn but well cared for. Weapons and armor—some finished, others in progress—hang from pegs or lean against the walls. Swords, shields, and helmets of various styles can be seen, alongside hunting knives, farming tools, and wagon parts awaiting repair.

The heart of the forge is a massive, well-worn anvil that stands in the center of the room, surrounded by barrels filled with scrap metal and water for tempering. The forge itself is a large stone hearth, always roaring with heat, casting a flickering light across the space. A grindstone sits in one corner, and nearby, a collection of exotic materials—leather, steel ingots, rare ores—are organized in wooden crates, waiting for use in her next creation.

**Back Room:**  
In a smaller, more private section of the forge, Ferra keeps her most prized and enchanted works, often locked behind a reinforced door. Only the most trusted clients are invited into this room. Here, shelves are filled with glowing shards of enchanted stones, rare gemstones, and partially finished weapons infused with magic. A long workbench, covered in scrolls and notes, details Ferra’s experiments with basic enchantments, including fire resistance, protection from arrows, or increased blade sharpness.

**Atmosphere:**  
The sound of the bellows fanning the flames and the constant clatter of metal fills the space, creating a symphony of productivity. Despite the heat and noise, the forge is organized chaos, and Ferra moves through it with practiced ease. There’s a sense of history here, with weapons from past wars hanging high on the walls, reminders of both the forge’s reputation and its darker past.
