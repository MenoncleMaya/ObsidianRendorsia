## **Outside**

The grand building forms a U-shape, with two wide ailes extending from the sides, creating an open courtyard in the center. The perimeter is surrounded by an intricate, black wrought-iron fence, with the top spikes designed to deter intruders. Above the gate, a large clock towers over the entrance, ticking ominously as the night approaches. Inside the gated area, guests can stroll through a well-manicured landscape, featuring a small **maze** of hedges for those wishing to seek privacy, and a **gazebo** at the far end of the lawn, softly illuminated by lanterns. The rest of the courtyard is covered in short, neatly-trimmed grass, perfect for outdoor mingling before the ball.

The building itself stands three stories high, its architectural style blending elegance and strength. Each of the **two ailes** features a **skydome** atop them, allowing natural light during the day and a view of the stars at night. The walls of the building are made from pale stone, adorned with tall windows and ornate ironwork.

## **Inside**

As the [[players]] enter, the opulence of the ball’s location becomes immediately clear. The grandeur of the building is reflected in every detail.

### **Entrance**

The main entrance opens into a large, high-ceilinged **foyer**. Chandeliers made of shimmering crystal hang overhead, casting a warm glow on the polished marble floor. The walls are decorated with large paintings of noble families, hinting at the wealth and history behind the event. Tall pillars line the walls, guiding guests further inside toward the ballroom. On each side of the entrance, a spiral staircase winds upwards, leading to the private balconies on the second and third floors.

Guests are welcomed by servants in formal attire, offering drinks and taking coats. A long carpet runs from the entrance to the main room, its rich red color adding to the sense of prestige.

### **Main Room**

The centerpiece of the building is the enormous **ballroom**, located directly beyond the foyer. The room is grand and circular, with a domed ceiling painted with scenes of mythological figures. Another grand chandelier, larger than the ones in the foyer, hangs in the center, sparkling like a constellation of stars.

The floor is polished wood, made for dancing, and the walls are lined with floor-to-ceiling mirrors, giving the room a sense of endless space. At one end of the room stands a raised platform where musicians play soft, classical music, filling the air with a sense of calm and refinement. The far end of the ballroom opens onto a terrace, overlooking the courtyard and maze below, offering a moment of respite from the festivities.

### **Ailes**

#### **Left Aile**

The **left aile** is quieter, reserved for private meetings and conversations. It consists of a series of **smaller salons** and rooms for more intimate discussions. Velvet-cushioned chairs and small tables offer places to sit and sip drinks, and the walls are lined with bookshelves and portraits of nobility. A few small, hidden alcoves provide spaces for hushed whispers away from prying eyes.

One particular room stands out—a private office with a large wooden desk and a balcony overlooking the courtyard. This room may be used by influential guests or nobles to conduct secret business deals or political negotiations.

#### **Right Aile**

The **right aile** is livelier, with a **dining hall** and **refreshment area** for guests to gather between dances. The hall is lined with long tables filled with extravagant food—roasted meats, fruits, cheeses, and delicate pastries. Servants circulate with trays of fine wine and champagne, ensuring that no guest's glass is ever empty.

In addition to the dining hall, the right aile has a set of **side rooms** where nobles can retire for a moment of quiet or discuss matters away from the festivities. These rooms are more modest, but no less elegant, with rich tapestries and plush seating. Some guests may use this aile to retreat, while others may see it as a strategic location to gather information or make alliances unnoticed.
