---
 The lair of the [[False Hydra]] of [[Semper]] is an enormous Room anciently the [[Lair of the Adventurers]]. an enormous room covered in drawings, symbols et mosaic. Some of the pillars are now broken on the ground alto the room still looks stable.  The lair is attached to the maze the [[Ã‰gout de Semper|Sewers of Semper]] are. The lair is inter connected by multiples cold and poorly lit tunnels infested by [[Carrow]]s. The only source of light are the [[Vertoincommodum]] which emits a dim red blood light. The closer the more uneasy the party will feel. Then there is this massive room, the cave, the lair. The room is big, cold, poorly lit, echo but most importantly great... no, perfect acoustic.
