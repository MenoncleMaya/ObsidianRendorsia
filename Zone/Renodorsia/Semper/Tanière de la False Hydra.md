  - False Hydra's Lair
---
 The lair of the [[False Hydra]] of [[Semper]] is an enormous. The lair is attached to the maze the [[Ã‰gout de Semper|Sewers of Semper]] are. The lair is inter connected by multiples cold and poorly lit tunnels infested by [[Carrow]]s. The only source of light are the [[Vertoincommodum]] which emits a dim red blood light. The closer the more uneasy the party will feel. Then there is this massive room, the cave, the lair. The room is big, cold, poorly lit, echo but most importantly great... no, perfect acoustic.
