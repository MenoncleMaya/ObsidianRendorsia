**Coldfair – The Frosted Heart of the Wilds**

Nestled amidst dense, snow-dusted forests and bordering the pristine waters of a glistening lake, Coldfair stands as a testament to resilience and community in a harsh and unforgiving landscape. This small village, enclosed by nature’s silent sentinels of pines and firs, thrives on the bounty of the land—timber from the great woods and the spoils of skilled hunting. The crisp, cold air carries the scent of woodsmoke and pine resin, mingling with the sharp tang of snow.

**Layout and Notable Features:**

- **Central Village Area**: At the heart of Coldfair, small timber and stone houses cluster close together, their steep roofs designed to shed heavy snowfall. Narrow paths weave through these homes, connecting villagers as they go about their daily work.
- **Tavern – The Frosted Horn**: The only place of communal warmth, the Frosted Horn stands near the center, marked by its dark wooden exterior and a sign shaped like a frost-covered hunting horn. Inside, the crackling fire and scent of mulled wine offer solace from the cold.
- **The Market Square**: An open area where traders display wares and trappers barter their pelts. The square is flanked by modest stalls and a few permanent shops selling essentials, like rope, traps, and cured meat.
- **Hunting Lodge**: Near the village’s edge, a hunting lodge serves as a meeting place for hunters and trappers to share tales and plan expeditions into the woods.
- **Forested Outskirts**: Dense woods hug Coldfair’s perimeter, home to abundant wildlife and whispered legends of shadowy creatures. The forest paths are often traveled by villagers collecting firewood or checking their traps.
- **Fields and Farmlands**: Although limited by the harsh climate, a few open fields show signs of cultivation, providing root vegetables and hardy grains to supplement the villagers' diets.

The soldiers bring tension to the otherwise close-knit community, turning casual glances into hushed conversations and hidden whispers.
