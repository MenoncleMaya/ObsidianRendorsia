(Guardian Angel)

[[Misha, The Unifying Blade]], loyal horse and best friend.

When [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]] was young, he was attacked by bandits. Thats when he met Shugo Tenshi. Shugo Tenshi fought the bandits off by trampling over them, eventually scaring them off saving the young lord.

It died during a stand with [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]] during [[The Invasion of Fort Alexander]]. In which Shugo Tenshi died of its wounds caused by a samurai of [[Emperor Karlington]]. Soon after, the great sorcerer [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]] enchanted [[Saigo No Iki]] which linked its soul to the blade, allowing [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]] to ride Shugo Tenshi into battle as a risen purple shadow.
