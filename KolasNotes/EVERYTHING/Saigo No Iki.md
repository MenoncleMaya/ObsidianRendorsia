**Short summary -**
The Saigo No Iki (Last Breath) is an Odachi mesuring 3 tanto, a Horseback sword first wielded by [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]]. It was later enchanted by a legendary sorcerer known as [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]] who granted it the power to harness its previous wielders techniques and meld it with its current wielder. 

For [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]], it gave him the power to resurect his best friend, his horse [[Shugo Tenshi]], as a purple shadow.

When [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]] fell to the magic of a great wizard who served
[[Emperor Karlington]], [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]] took the blade and fought the wizard.
It gave him the ability to dash a small distance and summon a ghost of [[Misha, The Unifying Blade]] and [[Shugo Tenshi]]. Which allowed him to overpower the wizard.
[[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]] was then assassinated during his sleep by a group of spies from [[Emperor Karlington]] who had earned the mages trust. 

A ratfolk thief, who was in [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]]'s room at the time of the execution, had stolen the [[Saigo No Iki]]. 
The thief was then attacked by the spies who he managed to fight off with his great cunning. The thief's name was [[Kazaktan, The Dishonored]], son of [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]]. [[Kazaktan, The Dishonored]] could use the [[Saigo No Iki]] to travel from shadow to shadow. 

When [[Bartolome, The Rushing Patience]] joined the kingdom of [[Gyatt]], [[Kazaktan, The Dishonored]] denounced himself and passed down the blade to Bartolome.
