Bartolome is a monk who sheltered Misha, a samurai from [[The Rebels of Freedom]], who he found half dead after the samurai's steed traveled to Bartolome's dojo with the samurai on its back.

Bartolome took care of the mans wounds and let him rest until he woke up.

"Who are you?" Said Misha, trying to get up.

"Sit down, samurai. Your wounds haven't fully healed." Declared Bartolome.

"Thank you healer, but I must go. The people of the Isle are still in danger from the wrath of the emperor." Insisting the samurai, rising again.

"You will die soon. That is, if you continue upon this path."

"If I can save a few more, I will have given all my worth to my people!" Exclaimed the hurried warrior.

"All your worth?" Bart chuckled. "Have you already given up samurai?"

"Given up? No. I am saying I'm going to sacrifice myself for my people, and you speak to me of having given up?" The strong build samurai proclaimed angerly.

"You've already admitted defeat. You will do nothing unless you learn to master your emotions."

"I have no time for that!" The warrior said, gathering his equipment, readying to leave.

"Fine, I will let you leave. But before you do, you must best me in combat." Said the young [[Giff]], smiling.

"You're just a kid. Plus you're not even a fighter!" Refused the man.

"Mistake number one. Assuming that because one does not want to fight, he cannot." Bart said leaving the house flourishing his bo-staff. [[Emperor Karlington]]
