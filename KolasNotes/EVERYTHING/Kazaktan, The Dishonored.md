Kazaktan Koreijutsu, a ratfolk thief who wielded the [[Saigo No Iki]]. He was the son of [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]]. 

He was in [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]]'s room at the time of his execution by spies. Fortunately, he had stolen the [[Saigo No Iki]]. 
The thief was then attacked by the spies who he managed to fight off with his great cunning. The thief's name was [[Kazaktan, The Dishonored]], son of [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]]. [[Kazaktan, The Dishonored]] could use the [[Saigo No Iki]] to travel from shadow to shadow. 

He practiced his own technique of fighting through evasion and subterfuge. It was seen as dishonorable, but he found it necessary in some circumstances. He helped secure many resources for the people of [[Gyatt]] and liberated many encampments to free the people of who would join [[Gyatt]]'s forces. He trained some of them in his way. Many disagreed with his ways, calling him a coward, but respecting his dedication to [[Gyatt]]. 

[[Bartolome, The Rushing Patience]] who was training both giffs and ratfolks at his temple near [[Fort Alexander]], the seat of [[Gyatt]]. Visited Kazaktan to help him in making decisions to further [[Gyatt]]'s influence across [[The Isles of Flowing Waters]]. After hearing [[Bartolome, The Rushing Patience]]'s strategies, Kazaktan revealed to the people the way he acquired [[Saigo No Iki]] and gave control of the military forces of [[Gyatt]] to [[Bartolome, The Rushing Patience]]. As the people started to renounce Kazaktan's technique, [[Bartolome, The Rushing Patience]] protected his honor and asked him to continue teaching his people who were naturally better at stealth. Kazaktan agreed and continue being held as king of [[Gyatt]] in memory of [[Fuyuujio, The great Necromancer]].

He had an only child, a girl named [[Eiko Koreijutsu]] who would become queen.

He died in his sleep peacefully at age 64
